    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The Chocolate Mug Cake is the ultimate "instant gratification" dessert, bridging the gap between a warm, homemade cake and a quick midnight snack.</p>
    <p>Here is what defines this treat:</p>
    <p>Single-Serving: It is designed to be made and eaten in a standard coffee mug, making it perfect for one person with zero leftovers.</p>
    <p>Speed: Unlike a traditional cake that takes an hour to bake, this uses microwave radiation to "bake" the batter in just 90 seconds.</p>
    <p>Texture: It typically turns out moist and dense, sitting somewhere between a fluffy sponge cake and a gooey brownie.</p>
    <p>Convenience: It requires no oven and very little cleanup. Since you mix the ingredients directly in the mug you eat from, you don't even dirty a mixing bowl.</p>
    <p>It is a favorite among students because it satisfies chocolate cravings immediately using basic pantry staples like flour, sugar, and cocoa powder.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour (Maida): 4 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Sugar: 3 tablespoons (add more if you like it very sweet)</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder: 2 tablespoons (OR crushed chocolate biscuits if you don't have cocoa)</li>
        <li>Milk: 4 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Oil (or Melted Butter): 2 tablespoons (any neutral oil like sunflower/soybean)</li>
        <li>Baking Powder: 1 tiny pinch (optional, but makes it fluffy)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>1.Dry Mix: Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking powder into the mug. Mix them well with a spoon so there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>2.Wet Mix: Add the milk and oil to the mug. Stir efficiently until you have a smooth, dark brown batter.</li>
        <li>3.Microwave: Put the mug in the microwave. Cook on High for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
            Check it: If it still looks liquid on top, microwave for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>4.Cool: Let it sit for 1 minute (it will be very hot).</li>
        <li>5.Enjoy: Eat it straight out of the mug.</li>
    </ol>
