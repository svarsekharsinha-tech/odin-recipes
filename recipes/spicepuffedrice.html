    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spicy Puffed Rice, most commonly known in Assam and West Bengal as Jhal Muri, is an iconic "no-cook" street food snack.</p>

    <p> Here is a quick breakdown of what makes it special:</p>

    <p> The Base: It uses crispy puffed rice (murmura) which is very light and airy. </p>

    <p> The Flavor: It is a bold explosion of tastes—spicy from green chilies, tangy from lime juice, and savory from black salt.</p>

    <p> The Secret Kick: The defining characteristic of authentic Jhal Muri is the splash of raw mustard oil, which adds a sharp, pungent zest that separates it from the sweeter "Bhel Puri" found in other parts of India.</p>
 
    <p> Experience: It is traditionally mixed fresh in front of you and served in a newspaper cone (thonga), making it the ultimate cheap and satisfying evening snack.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Puffed Rice (Murmura): 2 cups</li>
        <li>Onion: 1 small (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>Green Chili: 1 or 2 (finely chopped) - adjust for spice tolerance!</li>
        <li>Tomato: 1 small (chopped)</li>
        <li>Mixture/Bhujia/Sev: A handful (any packet of crunchy salty snack like Aloo Bhujia)</li>
        <li>Mustard Oil: 1 teaspoon (This is the secret ingredient for that authentic "Jhal Muri" kick)</li>
        <li>Salt: To taste (Black salt is better if you have it)</li>
        <li>Lemon: Half a lemon</li>
        <li>Optional: Boiled potato (cubed), cucumber (chopped), or roasted peanuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Chop Veggies: Finely chop the onions, green chilies, and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix Wet Ingredients: In your bowl, mix the chopped onions, chilies, tomatoes, salt, and mustard oil. Squishing the 
            onions and oil together slightly with a spoon (or clean hand) releases the flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the Crunch: Add the puffed rice (murmura) and the bhujia/mixture to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Toss: Squeeze the lemon juice over the top and mix everything immediately and thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Eat it right away! If you wait too long, the puffed rice will get soggy from the tomato and lemon juice.</li>
    </ol>
