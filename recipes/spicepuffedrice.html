    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spicy Puffed Rice, most commonly known in Assam and West Bengal as Jhal Muri, is an iconic "no-cook" street food snack.</p>

    <p> Here is a quick breakdown of what makes it special:</p>

    <p> The Base: It uses crispy puffed rice (murmura) which is very light and airy. </p>

    <p> The Flavor: It is a bold explosion of tastes—spicy from green chilies, tangy from lime juice, and savory from black salt.</p>

    <p> The Secret Kick: The defining characteristic of authentic Jhal Muri is the splash of raw mustard oil, which adds a sharp, pungent zest that separates it from the sweeter "Bhel Puri" found in other parts of India.</p>
 
    <p> Experience: It is traditionally mixed fresh in front of you and served in a newspaper cone (thonga), making it the ultimate cheap and satisfying evening snack.</p>
